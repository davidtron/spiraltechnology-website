David Parry
=================
is the founder of spiral technology, a web and software development company based in London.

With over 14 years experience in the industry, I work as a consultant, enjoy being involved with start-ups, helped found [lekane](http://www.lekane.com) in Helsinki and love hacking at new tech.

When I'm not glued to my screen, I like travelling, [snowboarding](http://instagr.am/p/BJPpU/) (badly), live music and pub crawling. Ideally all at once.
