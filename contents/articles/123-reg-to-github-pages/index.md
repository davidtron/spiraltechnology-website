After [building](../building-static-blog/index.html) this blog statically and pushing it up to GitHub as a project page,
I then wanted to point my domain at it.

<span class="more"></span>

My intention is to point the www subdomain of spiraltechnology.co.uk at my static website hosted by GitHub at [http://davidtron.github.io](http://davidtron.github.io)

1.  In the root of my website create a file called [CNAME](https://github.com/davidtron/spiraltechnology-website/blob/master/contents/CNAME) and put the name of my subdomain in it *www.spiraltechnology.co.uk*.
    Since my site is generated by wintersmith, I needed to drop the file into the contents directory before generating the site.
    This is then generated by wintersmith into my deployment directory and pushed to my GitHub userpage repository

```bash
cd ~/dev/spiraltechnology-website
wintersmith build
cd ~/dev/spiraltechnology-website-deploy
git add CNAME
git commit -a -m "Adding the CNAME for custom domain"
git push origin master
```

2.  The next step is to configure my DNS so that any requests for www.spiraltechnology.co.uk point to my GitHub user page.
    The help pages at [GitHub ][1] suggest that this is done using a CNAME entry at your domain provider.
    My domain is hosted with [123-reg](http://123-reg.co.uk) and it's relatively straightforward to update DNS entries for domains you own.
    Log on to 123 and you will be presented with your control panel

    ![123 reg control panel](123-control-panel.png)

    Find the domain you want to manage from the drop down and select 'Manage'
    ![123 domain controls](123-domain-options.png)

    Under the Advance domain settings, select 'Manage DNS'
    ![123 add DNS entry](added-cname-for-www-to-github.png)

    Finally add an entry for the subdomain (www.spiraltechnology.co.uk) pointing to the github userpage (davidtron.github.io)
