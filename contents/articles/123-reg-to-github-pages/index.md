After [building](../building-static-blog/index.html) this blog statically and pushing it up to github as a project page,
I then wanted to point my domain at it.

<span class="more"></span>

1. In the root of my website create a file called [CNAME](https://github.com/davidtron/spiraltechnology-website/blob/master/contents/CNAME) and put the name of my domain in it *spiraltechnology.co.uk*.
To do this in a wintersmith generated site, you need to drop the file into the contents directory before generating the site.   This is then generated by wintersmith and pushed to the gh branch of the website

```bash
cd ~/dev/spiraltechnology-website
wintersmith build
cd ~/dev/spiraltechnology-website-deploy
git add CNAME
git commit -a -m "Adding the CNAME for custom domain"
git push origin gh-pages
```
